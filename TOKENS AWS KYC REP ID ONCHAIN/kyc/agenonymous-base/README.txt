🛡️ Agenonymous - Anonymous Age Verification System
Revolutionary anonymous age verification for Telegram using TON blockchain technology. The world's first privacy-preserving, cryptographically-verified age verification system built natively for the Telegram ecosystem.
🚀 What is Agenonymous?
Agenonymous solves the age verification problem for the nascent adult/gaming economy on Telegram. Instead of invasive KYC that exposes user identity, we use:
Anonymous document verification (users tape over personal info)
Revolutionary 2-transaction wallet verification (98.7% cheaper than traditional methods)
TON blockchain cryptographic proofs (immutable verification records)
Native Telegram integration (seamless Stars payments & Mini App UX)
💡 Key Innovation: 2-Transaction Verification
Traditional age verification costs $3.45+ per user via expensive Soul-Bound Tokens. Our breakthrough approach:
System creates pre-funded TON wallet (0.02 TON) with 24-word seed phrase
User imports seed phrase into any TON wallet (Tonkeeper, etc.)
User sends back 0.001 TON to prove wallet ownership
Cryptographic proof recorded on TON blockchain
Result: Same security guarantees at $0.05 cost (98.7% savings)
💰 Business Model
User pays: $2.50 (250 Telegram Stars)
Affiliate commission: $1.50 (150 Stars) - 60% to drive viral growth
We keep: $1.00 (100 Stars) - 40% margin
Operating cost: ~$0.05 per verification
Net profit: $0.95 per verification (1,900% ROI)
